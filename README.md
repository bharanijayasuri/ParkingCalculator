# ParkingCalculator

I have used 

2017-09-07 16:50:00 To 2017-09-09 19:15:00
And 
2019-11-03 07:00:00 To 2019-11-05 11:15:00
as test values for the Short stay car park calculation

&&

2017-09-07 19:50:00 To 2017-09-09 05:20:00
 And
2020-05-17 12:50:00 To 2020-05-17 12:51:00 
as test values for the Long stay car park calculation.

The entire project is done on .Net Core 3.1

I have used the Options pattern to capture settings and calculation settings and used basic Factory pattern for loose coupling and dynamic object creation. 

I have tried to follow the SOLID principles and best practices to the best of my knowledge.

I have used simple MSUnit tests for the exceptions bit
